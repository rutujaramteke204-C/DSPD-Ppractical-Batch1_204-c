## 1b-To write a C program to implement the Binary Search algorithm using a function to locate an element in a sorted list.
## 1c-To create a structure for Student containing marks and display the list of students in descending order using Bubble Sort.
## 2-To design and implement a menu-driven C program for performing stack operations (push, pop, overflow, underflow, display) using arrays.
## 3-To design and implement a menu-driven C program for performing queue operations (insert, delete, overflow, underflow, display) using arrays.
## 4-To create and display a linked list by inserting integer elements and counting the number of nodes.
## 5-To write a program to insert and search nodes in a Binary Tree and perform inorder, preorder, and postorder traversals.
## 6-To implement a Binary Search Tree (BST) with operations: search, insert, and delete leaf elements
